# Awesome Abdomen

> A curated list of anatomical features in the human abdomen and relevant open datasets.

[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

Inspired by the [Awesome Manifesto](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/awesome.md), the goal is to create an **exhaustive** list of objects that could present in the human abdomen, along with all open datasets relevant to each object. See [awesome_anatomy.md](awesome_anatomy.md) for more information.

## Digestive Tract

The Digestive Tract is an organ system which takes in food, extracts energy and nutrients, and expels the remaining waste as feces. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract)

### Stomach

The stomach is located between the oesophegus and the small intestine. It secretes enzymes and acid to aid in digestion. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach)

- Gastritis
- Gastroenteritis
- Gastroparesis
- Non-ulcer Dyspepsia
- Peptic Ulcers

### Small Intestine

Also known as the small bowel, the small intestine lies between the stomach and the large intestine, and it consists of three distinct regions: the duodenum, jejunum, and the ileum. The primary function of the small intestine is the absorbtion of nutrients and minearals from food. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_intestine)

**Diseases & Open Data**

- Healthy Controls
- Celiac Disease
- Bowel Obstruction
- Inflamatory Bowel Disease
- Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth

### Large Intestine

Also known as the large bowel, the large intestine is the final part of the GI tract. In the order in which waste material travels through, it consists of cecum, ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon, rectum, and anal canal. It's primary purpose is absorbtion of water from waste material and storing feces. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_intestine)

**Diseases & Open Data**

- Healthy Controls
- Inflammatory Bowel Disease

### Appendix

The appendix is a finger-like tube connected to the cecum at the junction of the small and large intestines. It is often considered to be a vestigial organ due to the lack of side effects upon its removal, but there is evidence to suggest that it supports the growth of useful intestinal bacteria. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appendix_(anatomy))

## Accesories to Digestive Tract

These are organs which are not considered to be part of the digestive tract itself, but are nonetheless instrumental to digestion.

### Liver

The liver is located in the right upper abdomen below the diaphram. It produces biochemicals for digestion, regulates glycogen storage, red blood cell decomposition, and hormone production. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver)

### Gallbladder

The gallbladder is a small organ which lies beneath the liver. It receives and stores bile from the liver, and rleases it into the duodenum where it helps in the digestion of fats. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallbladder)

### Pancreas

The pancreas is located in the abdominal cavity behind the stomach. It secretes
several hormones into blood including insulin, as well as pancreatic juice into
the duodenum. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreas)

## Urinary System

The urinary system serves several purposes, including the elimination of waste, the regulation of blood volume and pressure, the regulation of levels of electrolytes adn metabolites, and the regulation of blood pH. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system)

### Kidneys

The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs located on the left and right in the retroperitoneal space. Kidneys' primary function is filtration of blood plasma, but they are also responsible for the synthesis of certain hormones and the conversion of vitamin D to calcitriol. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney)

### Uterus

Also known as the womb, the uterus is an organ of the female reproductive system. The superior end (the fundus) is connected to the fallopian tubes while the inferior end (the cervix) opes to the vagina. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus)

### Prostate

The prostate is a exocrine gland of the male reproductive system which sits between the bladder and the penis. The purpose of the prostate is to secrete an alkaline fluid constituting roughly 30% of the volume of semen, helping to neutralize the acidity of the vaginal tract.
